                <p>I was born in Alexandria, a historic city on the Mediterranean Sea in Egypt, known for its rich culture and stunning coastline.</p>
                <p>Despite its grandeur, life felt limited due to Egypt's centralized system, pushing me to explore beyond my surroundings.</p>
                <p>My passion for computers ignited in my teenage years, where I spent countless hours learning about hardware and software.</p>

                <p>In 2019, I founded FALSO, meaning "fake" in Egyptian slang, to combat misinformation as one of Egypt’s first fact-checking initiatives.</p>
                <p>Leading a team of 60 volunteers, we tackled false news, gaining significant traction during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
